# Code Katas

## Description

> A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition.

This repository contains a series of Katas intended for a developer to hone their Test Driven Development skills.

## String Sum Kata

- Write a simple String Sum utility with a function string Sum(string num1, string num2), which can accept only natural numbers and will return their sum. Replace entered number with 0 (zero) if entered number is not a natural number.
- Start with a simplest test case with an empty string
- Create a simple method string Sum(string num1, string num2)
- Write a test to pass small numbers and refactor, if test passed
try to write more code and refactor

## FizzBuzz Kata

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz"
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both
three and five print "FizzBuzz".
